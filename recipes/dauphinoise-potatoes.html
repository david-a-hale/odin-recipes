        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These Dauphinoise potatoes are luscious and creamy. The potatoes will be perfectly seasoned after absorbing all the flavor in the sauce, and come out super tender.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>i tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and sliced 1/8-inch thick with peel</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>4 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in flour; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Whisk in heavy cream, milk, and salt until smooth. Add sliced potatoes and bring to a simmer; cook, gently stirring occasionally, until potatoes begin to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in thyme and pepper.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the prepared baking dish; sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese evenly over potatoes. Top with remaining potatoes and spoon remaining liquid left in the pot over the potatoes. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened, top is browned in spots, and potatoes are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving; garnish with additional thyme.</li>
        </ol>
